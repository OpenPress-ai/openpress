# Dementor Development Log

## 2024-10-14: Initial Planning and Test Creation

1. Created `docs/dementor.md` with a comprehensive implementation plan for the Dementor page builder functionality.

2. Created `docs/dementor_tests.md` with a list of feature tests covering various aspects of the page builder.

3. Created `tests/Feature/PageBuilder/AdminPanelTest.php` with the following tests for the page builder integration in the admin panel using Pest syntax:

   - admin can see page builder in admin panel
   - admin can access page builder section
   - admin can see list of pages in page builder
   - admin can create new page with page builder
   - admin can edit existing page with page builder
   - non admin cannot access page builder section

4. Created `tests/Feature/PageBuilder/PageBuilderComponentsTest.php` with the following tests for the underlying components and functionality:

   - page builder routes are registered
   - page builder middleware is applied correctly
   - page builder menu item exists in admin panel
   - page builder can load required assets
   - page builder api endpoints are accessible
   - page builder can create a basic page structure

These tests ensure that:
- The Page Builder option is visible in the main admin panel for admin users.
- Admins can access the Page Builder section.
- Admins can view a list of pages created with the Page Builder.
- Admins can create new pages using the Page Builder.
- Admins can edit existing pages using the Page Builder.
- Non-admin users cannot access the Page Builder section.
- The necessary routes, middleware, and API endpoints are in place.
- The Page Builder can create and store basic page structures.

Next steps:
1. Implement the basic Page Builder functionality in the admin panel.
2. Create the necessary routes, controllers, and views for the Page Builder section.
3. Implement access control for the Page Builder section.
4. Develop the API endpoints for the Page Builder.
5. Create the database structure for storing Page Builder content.
6. Begin development of the core Page Builder components as outlined in the implementation plan.
7. Implement asset loading for the Page Builder (JS and CSS).
