# Dementor Development Log

## 2023-05-10: Initial Planning and Test Creation

1. Created `docs/dementor.md` with a comprehensive implementation plan for the Dementor page builder functionality.

2. Created `docs/dementor_tests.md` with a list of feature tests covering various aspects of the page builder.

3. Created `tests/Feature/PageBuilder/AdminPanelTest.php` with the following tests for the page builder integration in the admin panel:

   - test_admin_can_see_page_builder_in_admin_panel
   - test_admin_can_access_page_builder_section
   - test_admin_can_see_list_of_pages_in_page_builder
   - test_admin_can_create_new_page_with_page_builder
   - test_admin_can_edit_existing_page_with_page_builder
   - test_non_admin_cannot_access_page_builder_section

These tests ensure that:
- The Page Builder option is visible in the main admin panel for admin users.
- Admins can access the Page Builder section.
- Admins can view a list of pages created with the Page Builder.
- Admins can create new pages using the Page Builder.
- Admins can edit existing pages using the Page Builder.
- Non-admin users cannot access the Page Builder section.

Next steps:
1. Implement the basic Page Builder functionality in the admin panel.
2. Create the necessary routes, controllers, and views for the Page Builder section.
3. Implement access control for the Page Builder section.
4. Begin development of the core Page Builder components as outlined in the implementation plan.
