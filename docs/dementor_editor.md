# Dementor Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing the editor functionality in Dementor, our Laravel-based page builder inspired by Elementor. We'll adapt Elementor's editor code to work within our Laravel environment while maintaining as much of the original functionality as possible.

## Elementor Editor Structure

Based on the examination of Elementor's repository, the editor-related files are located in:

```
assets/dev/js/editor/
```

Key files and directories include:

- `editor.js`: Main editor file
- `editor-base.js`: Base editor functionality
- `components/`: Editor components
- `controls/`: Editor controls
- `elements/`: Element-related functionality
- `views/`: Editor views

## Steps

### 1. Set Up Front-end Assets

1.1. Create a new directory structure in our Laravel project:
```
resources/
└── js/
    └── page-builder/
        ├── editor/
        │   ├── components/
        │   ├── controls/
        │   ├── elements/
        │   └── views/
        └── editor.js
```

1.2. Use Vite to compile and version these assets.

### 2. Port Core Editor Functionality

2.1. Create a base `Editor` class in `resources/js/page-builder/editor.js`, adapting from Elementor's `editor.js` and `editor-base.js`.
2.2. Adapt the initialization process to work with Laravel's structure and Alpine.js.

### 3. Implement Editor Components

3.1. Examine and port relevant components from Elementor's `components/` directory.
3.2. Adapt components to work within our Laravel and Alpine.js environment.

### 4. Port Controls

4.1. Examine and port relevant controls from Elementor's `controls/` directory.
4.2. Adapt controls to work with our data structure and Alpine.js components.

### 5. Implement Elements

5.1. Port relevant element functionality from Elementor's `elements/` directory.
5.2. Ensure compatibility with our existing elements and widgets.

### 6. Adapt Views

6.1. Examine and port relevant views from Elementor's `views/` directory.
6.2. Convert views to Alpine.js components where appropriate.

### 7. Develop Backend Support

7.1. Create an `EditorController` to handle editor-related requests.
7.2. Implement API endpoints for saving and loading editor data.

### 8. Integrate with Existing Page Builder Components

8.1. Ensure the editor works with our existing elements and widgets.
8.2. Adapt the data structure to match our `PageBuilderData` model.

### 9. Implement Drag-and-Drop Functionality

9.1. Examine Elementor's drag-and-drop implementation in the `views/` directory.
9.2. Adapt the drag-and-drop functionality to work with Alpine.js.

### 10. Add Real-time Preview

10.1. Implement a preview pane that updates in real-time as changes are made.
10.2. Use Alpine.js reactivity system for real-time updates.

### 11. Implement Undo/Redo Functionality

11.1. Examine Elementor's history module in the `modules/history/` directory.
11.2. Implement a similar history system using Alpine.js state management.

### 12. Add Responsive Editing

12.1. Implement device preview modes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
12.2. Ensure that responsive settings are properly saved and applied.

### 13. Optimize Performance

13.1. Implement lazy loading for editor components.
13.2. Optimize asset loading and minimize initial load time.

### 14. Implement Global Settings

14.1. Create a settings panel for global styles and configurations.
14.2. Ensure these settings are properly applied across the editor.

### 15. Add Keyboard Shortcuts

15.1. Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
15.2. Provide a way for users to view and customize shortcuts.

### 16. Implement Context Menu

16.1. Create a context menu for quick actions on elements.
16.2. Ensure the context menu is easily extensible for future additions.

## Considerations

1. **Laravel Integration**: Ensure all JavaScript code is properly integrated with Laravel's structure and asset compilation process using Vite.

2. **Alpine.js Compatibility**: Adapt Elementor's jQuery-based code to work with Alpine.js components and reactivity system.

3. **Database Structure**: Adapt Elementor's data structure to work with our `PageBuilderData` model and Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

4. **API Design**: Create a clean API for the editor to communicate with the backend, following Laravel best practices.

5. **Extensibility**: Design the editor structure to be easily extensible, allowing for future additions of custom widgets and features.

6. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive JavaScript tests for the editor functionality.

7. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for how to use and extend the editor.

## Next Steps

1. Begin by porting the core editor functionality from `editor.js` and `editor-base.js`.
2. Implement basic components and controls.
3. Develop the drag-and-drop feature and real-time preview.
4. Gradually add more advanced features like undo/redo and responsive editing.
5. Continuously test and refine the editor as it's being developed.

By following this plan, we'll create a robust and feature-rich editor for our Dementor page builder, leveraging the strengths of Elementor while adapting it to our Laravel and Alpine.js-based architecture.
