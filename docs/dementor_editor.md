# Dementor Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing the editor functionality in Dementor, our Laravel-based page builder inspired by Elementor. We'll adapt Elementor's editor code to work within our Laravel environment while maintaining as much of the original functionality as possible.

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Elementor's Editor Structure

1.1. Identify key JavaScript files:
- `assets/js/editor.js`
- `assets/js/editor-modules/`
- `assets/js/editor-document/`

1.2. Identify key PHP files:
- `includes/editor.php`
- `includes/editor-templates/`

### 2. Set Up Front-end Assets

2.1. Create a new directory structure in our Laravel project:
```
resources/
└── js/
    └── page-builder/
        ├── editor.js
        └── modules/
```

2.2. Use Laravel Mix to compile and version these assets.

### 3. Port Core Editor Functionality

3.1. Create a base `Editor` class in `resources/js/page-builder/editor.js`.
3.2. Port essential modules from Elementor's `editor-modules/` to our `modules/` directory.
3.3. Adapt the initialization process to work with Laravel's structure.

### 4. Implement Editor Templates

4.1. Create Blade templates for editor components in `resources/views/page-builder/editor/`.
4.2. Port Elementor's editor templates, converting them to Blade syntax.

### 5. Develop Backend Support

5.1. Create an `EditorController` to handle editor-related requests.
5.2. Implement API endpoints for saving and loading editor data.

### 6. Integrate with Existing Page Builder Components

6.1. Ensure the editor works with our existing elements and widgets.
6.2. Adapt the data structure to match our `PageBuilderData` model.

### 7. Implement Drag-and-Drop Functionality

7.1. Port Elementor's drag-and-drop code, adapting it to our structure.
7.2. Ensure smooth integration with our Laravel-based backend.

### 8. Add Real-time Preview

8.1. Implement a preview pane that updates in real-time as changes are made.
8.2. Use Laravel Echo or a similar solution for real-time updates if necessary.

### 9. Implement Undo/Redo Functionality

9.1. Port Elementor's history module, adapting it to our needs.
9.2. Ensure proper state management for undo/redo actions.

### 10. Add Responsive Editing

10.1. Implement device preview modes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
10.2. Ensure that responsive settings are properly saved and applied.

### 11. Optimize Performance

11.1. Implement lazy loading for editor components.
11.2. Optimize asset loading and minimize initial load time.

### 12. Implement Global Settings

12.1. Create a settings panel for global styles and configurations.
12.2. Ensure these settings are properly applied across the editor.

### 13. Add Keyboard Shortcuts

13.1. Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
13.2. Provide a way for users to view and customize shortcuts.

### 14. Implement Context Menu

14.1. Create a context menu for quick actions on elements.
14.2. Ensure the context menu is easily extensible for future additions.

## Considerations

1. **Laravel Integration**: Ensure all JavaScript code is properly integrated with Laravel's structure and asset compilation process.

2. **Vue.js Compatibility**: If using Vue.js in other parts of the application, consider how the editor will interact with Vue components.

3. **Database Structure**: Adapt Elementor's data structure to work with our `PageBuilderData` model and Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

4. **API Design**: Create a clean API for the editor to communicate with the backend, following Laravel best practices.

5. **Extensibility**: Design the editor structure to be easily extensible, allowing for future additions of custom widgets and features.

6. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive JavaScript tests for the editor functionality.

7. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for how to use and extend the editor.

## Next Steps

1. Begin by porting the core editor functionality and basic UI.
2. Implement the drag-and-drop feature and real-time preview.
3. Gradually add more advanced features like undo/redo and responsive editing.
4. Continuously test and refine the editor as it's being developed.

By following this plan, we'll create a robust and feature-rich editor for our Dementor page builder, leveraging the strengths of Elementor while adapting it to our Laravel-based architecture.
