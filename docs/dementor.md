# Dementor: OpenPress Page Builder Implementation Plan

## Overview

Dementor is the codename for our Elementor-like page builder functionality in OpenPress. This document outlines the plan for implementing this feature in a way that can be later extracted into a standalone Composer package.

## Structure

We will create a new directory called `PageBuilder` within the `app` directory to house all the page builder-related code. This will make it easier to extract the functionality into a separate package later.

```
app/
└── PageBuilder/
    ├── Contracts/
    ├── Elements/
    ├── Widgets/
    ├── Services/
    ├── Models/
    ├── Facades/
    └── Providers/
```

## Components

### 1. Elements

- Create an abstract `Element` class in `app/PageBuilder/Elements/Element.php`
- Implement concrete element classes (e.g., `Section`, `Column`) in the same directory

### 2. Widgets

- Create an abstract `Widget` class in `app/PageBuilder/Widgets/Widget.php`
- Implement concrete widget classes (e.g., `TextEditor`, `Image`, `Button`) in the same directory

### 3. Data Storage

- Create a `PageBuilderData` model in `app/PageBuilder/Models/PageBuilderData.php`
- This model will handle the storage and retrieval of page builder data using Laravel's Eloquent ORM

### 4. Rendering Engine

- Create a `RenderingService` in `app/PageBuilder/Services/RenderingService.php`
- This service will be responsible for rendering the page builder elements and widgets

### 5. Data Management

- Create a `DataManagementService` in `app/PageBuilder/Services/DataManagementService.php`
- This service will handle saving, updating, and retrieving page builder data

### 6. Facades

- Create a `PageBuilder` facade in `app/PageBuilder/Facades/PageBuilder.php`
- This facade will provide a convenient interface to interact with the page builder functionality

### 7. Service Provider

- Create a `PageBuilderServiceProvider` in `app/PageBuilder/Providers/PageBuilderServiceProvider.php`
- This provider will register the page builder services, facades, and any necessary bindings

## Implementation Steps

1. **Core Classes and Interfaces**
   - Define the `Element` and `Widget` abstract classes
   - Create interfaces for key components in the `Contracts` directory

2. **Basic Elements and Widgets**
   - Implement basic elements like `Section` and `Column`
   - Create essential widgets such as `TextEditor`, `Image`, and `Button`

3. **Data Storage**
   - Implement the `PageBuilderData` model
   - Create necessary database migrations for storing page builder data

4. **Rendering Engine**
   - Develop the `RenderingService` to interpret and render the page builder data
   - Implement methods for rendering individual elements and widgets

5. **Data Management**
   - Create the `DataManagementService` for CRUD operations on page builder data
   - Implement methods for saving, updating, and retrieving page layouts

6. **Facade and Service Provider**
   - Implement the `PageBuilder` facade for easy access to page builder functionality
   - Create the `PageBuilderServiceProvider` to register services and bindings

7. **Integration with Laravel**
   - Update `config/app.php` to include the `PageBuilderServiceProvider`
   - Create configuration files for the page builder (e.g., `config/pagebuilder.php`)

8. **Front-end Integration**
   - Develop Blade components for rendering page builder elements and widgets
   - Create JavaScript modules for handling front-end interactions (using Vite)

9. **Admin Interface**
   - Create controllers and views for the admin interface to manage pages
   - Implement a drag-and-drop interface using a front-end library (e.g., Vue.js or Alpine.js)

10. **Testing**
    - Write unit tests for individual components (elements, widgets, services)
    - Create feature tests for the page builder functionality

11. **Documentation**
    - Write comprehensive documentation for using and extending the page builder
    - Include examples and best practices

## Considerations for Future Package Extraction

- Keep all page builder code within the `app/PageBuilder` directory
- Use dependency injection and interfaces to minimize coupling with the rest of the application
- Avoid direct use of Laravel facades or helpers within the page builder code; instead, use dependency injection
- Create a separate configuration file for the page builder
- Use Laravel's package discovery feature for easy integration when extracted

## Next Steps

1. Set up the basic directory structure for the page builder
2. Implement core classes and interfaces
3. Create basic elements and widgets
4. Develop the data storage model and migrations

By following this plan, we'll create a modular and extensible page builder system that can be easily extracted into a standalone package in the future.
